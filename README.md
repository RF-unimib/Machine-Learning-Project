# Machine Learning Project – Price Prediction

## Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build and evaluate Machine Learning models for predicting house prices based on structured property data.

The project focuses on understanding how different features contribute to price formation and how model performance changes depending on feature selection and validation strategy. In particular, the analysis explores the distribution of the target variable (both price and its log-transformed version), applies preprocessing techniques, and tests multiple configurations to improve predictive performance.

Model evaluation is conducted using both holdout validation and cross-validation in order to assess generalization capability and reduce overfitting risk. Performance is measured through R² (coefficient of determination) and RMSE (root mean squared error), allowing a comparison between different model setups.

The final goal is to identify the most effective combination of features and modeling approach that ensures accurate and robust price predictions.
